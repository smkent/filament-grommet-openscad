## Description

This is an OpenSCAD-configurable grommet I designed for my 3D printer enclosure.
It has a configurable taper on the interior to reduce the enclosure opening size
with the grommet installed.

With a 1/4" straight bit on my wood router, I cut out a straight line and then
printed a grommet using this design based on the size. The grommet rests in the
cut out slot in my enclosure.

This prints upside down without support.
